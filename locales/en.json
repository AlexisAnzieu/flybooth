        "q1": "How does it work?",

        "a3": "The photos are kept for 7 days during which participants can review or download them from a dedicated gallery.",
        "q4": "How many photos can participants post?",
        "a4": "Participants can post up to 1000 photos per event. This limit can be increased by increments of $10/1000 additional photos. More information by email."
